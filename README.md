# Notes Web Application
This web application is designed to help you organize your notes efficiently. It offers various features including managing all notes, archiving notes, and moving them to trash. Here's a breakdown of the features:

## Features

### All Notes
In this section, you can see all your notes at a glance. It provides an easy way to access and manage all your notes regardless of their status. You can add notes and easily search for specific notes, edit them, or delete them if necessary.

### Archive Note
The archive feature allows you to store notes that you want to keep but don't need to see frequently. Archived notes are moved out of the main view, decluttering your workspace while still keeping them accessible whenever you need them. You can easily retrieve archived notes or move them back to the main notes section.

### Trash Note
Notes that are no longer needed can be moved to the trash. This feature helps you declutter your notes by temporarily storing them in the trash bin. You can restore notes from the trash if needed or permanently delete them to free up space.
